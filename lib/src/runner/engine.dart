/// [run] won't terminate until [suiteSink] is closed. Suites will be run in the
/// order they're provided to [suiteSink]. Tests within those suites will

/// contain, referred to as "load tests". Load tests exist to provide visibility

/// test fails, it will be added to [failed] and [liveTests].
