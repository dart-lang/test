/// An [Engine] manages a run that encompasses multiple test suites.
///
/// Test suites are provided by passing them into [suiteSink]. Once all suites
/// have been provided, the user should close [suiteSink] to indicate this.
/// [run] won't terminate until [suiteSink] is closed. Suites will be run in the
/// order they're provided to [suiteSink]. Tests within those suites will
/// likewise be run in the order they're declared.
///
/// The current status of every test is visible via [liveTests]. [onTestStarted]
/// can also be used to be notified when a test is about to be run.
///
/// The engine has some special logic for [LoadSuite]s and the tests they
/// contain, referred to as "load tests". Load tests exist to provide visibility
/// into the process of loading test files, but as long as that process is
/// proceeding normally users usually don't care about it, so the engine only
/// surfaces running load tests (that is, includes them in [liveTests] and other
/// collections) under specific circumstances.
///
/// If only load tests are running, exactly one load test will be in [active]
/// and [liveTests]. If this test passes, it will be removed from both [active]
/// and [liveTests] and *will not* be added to [passed]. If at any point a load
/// test fails, it will be added to [failed] and [liveTests].

/// engine; it doesn't need to be added to [suiteSink] manually.
