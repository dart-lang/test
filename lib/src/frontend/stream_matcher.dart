/// The type for [_StreamMatcher._matchQueue].
typedef Future<String> _MatchQueue(StreamQueue queue);

/// A matcher that matches events from [Stream]s or [StreamQueue]s.
///
/// Stream matchers are designed to make it straightforward to create complex
/// expectations for streams, and to interleave expectations with the rest of a
/// test. They can be used on a [Stream] to match all events it emits:
///
/// ```dart
/// expect(stream, emitsInOrder([
///   // Values match individual events.
///   "Ready.",
///
///   // Matchers also run against individual events.
///   startsWith("Loading took"),
///
///   // Stream matchers can be nested. This asserts that one of two events are
///   // emitted after the "Loading took" line.
///   emitsAnyOf(["Succeeded!", "Failed!"]),
///
///   // By default, more events are allowed after the matcher finishes
///   // matching. This asserts instead that the stream emits a done event and
///   // nothing else.
///   emitsDone
/// ]));
/// ```
///
/// It can also match a [StreamQueue], in which case it consumes the matched
/// events. The call to [expect] returns a [Future] that completes when the
/// matcher is done matching. You can `await` this to consume different events
/// at different times:
///
/// ```dart
/// var stdout = new StreamQueue(stdoutLineStream);
///
/// // Ignore lines from the process until it's about to emit the URL.
/// await expect(stdout, emitsThrough("WebSocket URL:"));
///
/// // Parse the next line as a URL.
/// var url = Uri.parse(await stdout.next);
/// expect(url.host, equals('localhost'));
///
/// // You can match against the same StreamQueue multiple times.
/// await expect(stdout, emits("Waiting for connection..."));
/// ```
///
/// Users can call [new StreamMatcher] to create custom matchers.

  ///
  /// * If it matches successfully, it should return `null` and possibly consume

  /// * If it fails to match, consume no events and return a description of the
  ///   failure.
  /// * The description should be in past tense.
  /// * The description should be gramatically valid when used after "the
  ///   stream"â€”"emitted the wrong events", for example.
