// TODO(nweiz): Move this into the analyzer once it starts using SourceSpan
// (issue 22977).
/// Takes a span whose source is the value of a string that has been parsed from
/// a Dart file and returns the corresponding span from within that Dart file.
///
/// For example, suppose a Dart file contains `@Eval("1 + a")`. The
/// [StringLiteral] `"1 + a"` is extracted; this is [context]. Its contents are
/// then parsed, producing an error pointing to [span]:
///
///     line 1, column 5:
///     1 + a
///         ^
///
/// This span isn't very useful, since it only shows the location within the
/// [StringLiteral]'s value. So it's passed to [contextualizeSpan] along with
/// [context] and [file] (which contains the source of the entire Dart file),
/// which then returns:
///
///     line 4, column 12 of file.dart:
///     @Eval("1 + a")
///                ^
///
/// This properly handles multiline literals, adjacent literals, and literals
/// containing escape sequences. It does not support interpolated literals.
///
/// This will return `null` if [context] contains an invalid string or does not
/// contain [span].
