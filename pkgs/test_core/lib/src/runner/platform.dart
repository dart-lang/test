/// A minimal plugin must define [loadChannel], which connects to a client in
/// which the tests are defined. This is enough to support most of the test
/// runner's functionality.
///
/// In order to support interactive debugging, a plugin must override [load] as
/// well, which returns a [RunnerSuite] that can contain a custom [Environment]
/// and control debugging metadata such as [RunnerSuite.isDebugging] and
/// [RunnerSuite.onDebugging]. The plugin must create this suite by calling the
/// [deserializeSuite] helper function.

/// A platform plugin can be registered by passing it to [new Loader]'s
/// `plugins` parameter.

  /// [deserializeSuite]. However, it can be overridden to provide more
  /// fine-grained control over the [RunnerSuite], including providing a custom
