## 0.4.9

* Wait for paused VM platform isolates before shutdown.

## 0.4.8

* Add logging about enabling stack trace chaining to the compact and expanded
  reporters (moved from the invoker). This will now only be logged once after
  all tests have ran.

## 0.4.7

* Fix parsing of file paths into a URI on windows.

## 0.4.6

* Support query parameters `name`, `full-name`, `line`, and `col` on test paths,
  which will apply the filters to only those test suites.
  * All specified filters must match for a test to run.
  * Global filters (ie: `--name`) are also still respected and must match.
  * The `line` and `col` will match if any frame from the test trace matches
    (the test trace is the current stack trace where `test` is invoked).
* Support the latest `test_api`.

## 0.4.5

* Use newer analyzer APIs.

## 0.4.4

* Support the latest `test_api`.

## 0.4.3

* Add configuration to disallow duplicate test and group names by default. See
  the [docs][allow_duplicate_test_names] for more information.

## 0.4.1

* Use the latest `package:matcher`.

## 0.4.0

* **BREAKING**: All parameters to the `SuiteConfiguration` and `Configuration`
  constructors are now required. Some specialized constructors have been added
  for the common cases where a subset are intended to be provided.
* **BREAKING**: Remove support for `FORCE_TEST_EXIT`.
* Report incomplete tests as errors in the JSON reporter when the run is
  canceled early.
* Don't log the --test-randomization-ordering-seed if using the json reporter.
* Add a new exit code, 79, which is used when no tests were ran.
  * Previously you would have gotten either exit code 1 or 65 (65 if you had
    provided a test name regex).
* When no tests were ran but tags were provided, list the tag configuration.
* Update `analyzer` constraint to `>=1.0.0 <3.0.0`.

## 0.3.29

* Fix a bug where a tag level configuration would cause test suites with that
  tag to ignore the `--test-randomize-ordering-seed` argument.

## 0.3.28

* Add `time` field to the json reporters `allSuites` event type so that all
  event types can be unified.

## 0.3.27

* Restore the `Configuration.loadFromString` constructor.

## 0.3.26

* Give a better error when `printOnFailure` is called from outside a test
  zone.

  unsound null safety modes.

  surface area.
* Remove `suiteChannel`. This is now handled by an additional argument to the
  `beforeLoad` callback in `serializeSuite`.
* Disable stack trace chaining by default.
* Change the default way VM tests are launched and ran to greatly speed up
  loading performance.
  * You can force the old strategy with `--use-data-isolate-strategy` flag if
    you run into issues, but please also file a bug.
* Improve the error message for `hybridMain` functions with an incompatible
  StreamChannel parameter type.
* Change the `message` argument to `PlatformPlugin.load` to `Map<String,
  Object?>`. In an upcoming release this will be required as the type for this
  argument when passed through to `deserializeSuite`.
