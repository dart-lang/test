## What's here?

Welcome! [package:test](pkgs/test/) is the standard testing library for Dart and
Flutter. If you have questions about Dart testing, please see the docs for
[package:test](pkgs/test/). `package:test_api` and `package:test_core`
are implementation details and generally not user-facing.

[package:checks](pkgs/checks/) is a relatively new library for expressing test
expectations. It's a more modern version of `package:matcher` and features a
literate API.
